<p>For a small town, Tuaran certainly has plenty to say. And while it's become appealing to tourists in west Sabah, thanks to the Ling Sang Pagoda and the nearby Crocker Range National Park, it's also home to some of the state's best food and drink.</p>
<p>Tuaran saw its beginnings as a trading post, and some say that's where it got its name. Either way, today it's a laid-back community that thrums with life every Sunday market day, and the town today also hosts a superb mix of activities. Tuaran Crocodile Farm and Dalit Bay Golf Club are just two examples.</p>
