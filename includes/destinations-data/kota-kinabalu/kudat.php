<p>Kudat Town is the capital of the Kudat District, tucked up in the northern edges of Borneo Island. It enjoys a thriving subculture of Hakka Chinese people, together with a rich history seen in its buildings and cuisine. However, Kudat Town is a relaxed place to be, a far cry from what you might expect of a regional capital.</p>
<p>While the local fish and food markets are lively, the real bustle of Kudat faded in the 1800s along with its status as a trading post, leaving it sleepy and welcoming today.</p>
