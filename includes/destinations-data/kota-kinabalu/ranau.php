<p>The modern town of Ranau is located in a lush and hilly part of Sabah, over 1,000 metres above sea level. While it was once a little town people only passed through when getting from A to B, plenty of visitors now opt to stay a little longer.</p>
<p>Ranau is close to Mount Kinabalu, which draws plenty of adventurers, while the Saturday Night Market keeps hagglers awake until the early hours. Yet for foodies, there's also a wealth of flavours to experience in this small valley town, as well as hot springs and tea gardens to explore beyond the outskirts.</p>
