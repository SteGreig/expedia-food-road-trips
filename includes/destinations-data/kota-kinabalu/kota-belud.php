<p>Kota Belud is a town on the west coast of Sabah State, enjoying a breezy, tropical climate. With a population of around 10,000, it's got a small town feel but also plenty to offer, especially in its cuisine.</p>
<p>While the water plays a big role in life in Kota Belud - from fishing to swimming - its mosque and bustling Sunday market make it worth visiting. You'll find cows wandering free in the streets here too, adding a rustic charm. Kota Belud is also close to beaches like Mantanani, which helps keep local tourism healthy.</p>

        "description" => "Sabah has been called the noodle capital of Malaysia and has a couple of unique ways of serving them. While traditional noodle soups are easily found in Kota Belud, you can also enjoy dry chicken, beef or pork noodles. In this variation, the broth is served on a bowl on one side, with the noodles presented on your plate. At RM5 per portion, this makes a good appetiser or quick meal. A popular option, especially in Kota Belud but also wider Sabah, is to enjoy either a noodle soup or dry noodles with crispy fried shallots. The ones grown in the region surrounding Kota Belud make for particularly strong scents and flavours, and many visitors ensure their noodle bowls are piled high with shallots as well as their chicken, beef or pork staples.",
