$description = "
<p>Set on the southern region of the Malay Peninsula, Melaka is known as the historic state. Its location between Johor and Negeri Sembilan once made it the perfect trading destination and brought Indian, Chinese and Asian traders in large numbers over the 15th century and beyond. Today the city is diverse in its historic architecture, and the mix of cultures is evident throughout.</p>
<p>Days in Melaka can be spent on foot, as the vast majority of major attractions are all within a 1 kilometre radius. Walk your way through the Sultanate Palace Museum, Baba-Nyonya Heritage Museum, little India sector and Melaka's own Chinatown. The historical city centre has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2008.
