<p>Heading off the beaten track to Kulim offers some small town charm well worth the trip. The local point of pride is the Merdeka Clock Tower, a tall white tower with blue accents.</p>
<p>A stroll around the Hi-Tech Park and its gazebos shows the locals enjoying food from around the globe. It's just one of the reasons why Kulim's beloved reputation among foodies is so deserved.</p>
