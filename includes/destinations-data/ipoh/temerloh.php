<p>This central Malaysian town is surrounded by mountains and rainforests, where you can visit animal parks and an elephant sanctuary. It’s well connected by a main road to Kuala Lumpur, 130 kilometres away, but feels like a world away in lifestyle.</p>
<p>Situated at the junction of the Pahang River and the Semantan River, Temerloh is known for its abundance of freshwater fish and prawns, particularly catfish, or ikan patin. You can try the fish in local restaurants as well as head to the river to watch the catfish farmers at work.</p>
