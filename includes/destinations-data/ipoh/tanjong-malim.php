<p>Located 70 kilometres north of Kuala Lumpur, you can take the high-speed electric train to get to Tanjong Malim in no time. The small town has been designated one of four youth towns in Malaysia, and its young energy is displayed through stylish street art and art cafes.</p>
<p>Tanjong Malim is a food hub, famed for its Pau steamed dumplings perhaps even more than the fact it’s home to Proton City. Malaysia’s number one car manufacturer has an assembly plant, residential area and recreation hub at Embayu Lake Garden on the town’s outskirts. Water plays a big part in Tanjong Malim’s attraction, with waterfalls and hot springs to visit, as well as water rafting and tubing for the more active.</p>
