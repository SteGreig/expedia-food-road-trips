<p>A coastal town in northwest Malaysia, Sitiawan has good transport links to Kuala Lumpur, around 20 kilometres south. Although a small town, Sitiawan is busy as it’s close to Malaysia’s largest naval base at Lumut.</p>
<p>As well as rubber production, fishing and prawn farming are key industries here, so you’ll find plenty of seafood on the menus. Pau steamed dumplings and Chinese braised noodles are also popular here. Sitiawan has a grand Chinese temple, as well as the waterfront area where you can watch the boats, visit a maritime museum, or take a trip over to Pangkor Island, for its excellent beaches.</p>
