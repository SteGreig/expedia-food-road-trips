<p>Taking its name from the Selangor river, Kuala Selangor is where some of the best seafood west of Kuala Lumpur can be found. The town is enriched by an idyllic bustle and wears its love of history on its sleeve. There's a lively, modern feel to the area too though – the Sri Shakti Devasthanam Hindu Temple in nearby Bukit Rotan was finished in 2013.</p>
