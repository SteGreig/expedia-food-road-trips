<p>Located deep in the jungle of southern Kelentan, Gua Musang is a small town that packs plenty of punch. This once humble railway village has undergone significant modernisation over the last few decades, particularly in the town centre. Despite this, many areas on the outskirts of Gua Musang have retained much of their rural, small-town charm.</p>
<p>Surrounded by vast limestone hills and situated at the foot of the Bukit Gua Musang peak, the town is naturally popular among rock climbing and caving enthusiasts. It also serves as a gateway to one of Malaysia’s most famed National Parks, Taman Negara.</p>
