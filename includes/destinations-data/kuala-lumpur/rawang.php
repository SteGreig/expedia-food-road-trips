<p>Northwest of Kuala Lumpur, Rawang is an inland retreat near the Batu Caves. It's an up and coming town, and from 2026 onwards the biggest mall in Malaysia will open here. That mall, The Two, will come complete with its own theme park and boutiques of all kinds. Even today though, Rawang promises community spirit and flavours aplenty.</p>
