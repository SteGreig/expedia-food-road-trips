<p>Once a small village by the Kinta River, Ipoh began to grow expediently thanks to the huge deposits of tin discovered in the 1880's. Even so, its bustling streets and colonial architecture come second place to the city's natural attractions.</p>
<p>Ipoh is renowned for its limestone hills and caves, which have had Buddhist temples built within them. Today you can wander around the stunning outside gardens and explore inside the caves, which is said to be almost 570 million years old. The city is also famed for its fantastic Chinese food, driven by its majority Chinese population.</p>
