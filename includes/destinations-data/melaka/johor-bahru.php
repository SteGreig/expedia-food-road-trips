<p>The bustling capital of Johor State is a coastal tourist hotspot, but smart travellers know how to make the most of the city. While the likes of Sanrio Hello Kitty Town and Danga Bay draw plenty of crowds, it's Johor Bahru's food scene that's worth your attention.</p>
<p>Johor Bahru has a booming population and, as an economic centre, boasts plenty of shopping opportunities. There's also the Hutan Bandar for a rainforest experience in the midst of the city.</p>
