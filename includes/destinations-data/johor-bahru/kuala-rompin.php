<p>Situated along Malaysia’s eastern coast is Kuala Rompin. Just three hours from Kuala Lumpur, the town is regarded as the main gateway to Tioman Island, yet the restaurants here are worth the visit in themselves. Owing to its coastal location, each is stocked high with fresh seafood caught at nearby Sungai Rompin.</p>
<p>Kuala Rompin is one of the most renowned fishing regions in all of Malaysia and is steeped in maritime history. The sailfish is held in particularly high regard here, with the area even hosting the annual Royal Pahang International Billfish Challenge, a world-class fishing competition.</p>
