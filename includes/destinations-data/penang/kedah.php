<p>Bordering Northwest Thailand, Kedah has earned the nickname 'the rice bowl' of Malaysia thanks to its vast paddy fields along the western plain. Most of Kedah's terrain is used to grow rice, apart from the islands of Langkawi, which are situated 30 kilometres off the mainland coast. Langkawi Island was given a World Geopark status by UNESCO and tourists can visit via a ferry ride or domestic flight.</p>
<p>The southern Langkawi islands are home to gorgeous white sand beaches, lined with numerous restaurants and bars. They're ideal for days lounging on the coast and soaking up the Malaysian sunshine.</p>
