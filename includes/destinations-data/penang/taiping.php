<p>Taiping is the second largest town in Perak and was once the state capital. Today it's famous for its weather, and is known as the wettest town in Peninsular Malaysia. All this rain has done some good and attributes to Taiping's beautiful flowers and century-old rain trees in the Taiping Lake Gardens – a public garden established during the British rule in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Although likely raining during a visit, there's still plenty to do including visiting the Perak State Museum, Taiping Zoo and the Lake and Tulip Gardens.</p>
