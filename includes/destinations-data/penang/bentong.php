<p>Bentong was built around the Repas and Perting rivers, when tin was discovered in both bodies of water and the population soared. The name Bentong derives from the meaning 'profitable ridge', and today it continues to be profitable with bustling markets, soy sauce and tofu puff factories, numerous restaurants and the Resorts World Genting – home to six larger than life hotels with theme parks attached.</p>
<p>Known for its famous Bentong ginger, this rural town is also a food haven for spice-lovers.</p>
