<p>Bayan Baru in southeast Penang is a township that sprung up thanks to the industry surrounding it, especially at Bayan Lepas. Yet what makes Bayan Baru really stand out from the crowd is its fantastic foodie scene, together with the dense variety of shopping centres like Sunshine Square and Queensway Mall. What's more, being so close to the sea ensures that both fresh seafood and ingredients imported at the nearby ports make for fantastic fare.</p>
