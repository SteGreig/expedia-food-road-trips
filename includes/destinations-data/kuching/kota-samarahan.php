<p>Officially known as the 'Town of Knowledge', Kota Samarahan is the main hub for education in the Sarawak State, and the home of Malaysia's first public university. Before this city's focus turned to education, Kota Samarahan was known for its peat soil and flat, low-lying topography, ideal for coconut, oil palm and pineapple plantations.</p>
<p>Today this growing, modern city sees a wide range of visitors, from those wanting to check out its university campuses and educational facilities, to those who would rather visit its newly built, three-storey shopping centre, The Summer Shopping Mall.</p>
