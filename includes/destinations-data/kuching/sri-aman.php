<p>Located in East Malaysia, Sri Aman is both a market and port town, famed for trading in timber, oil palm, rubber and pepper. Sri Aman means the 'town of peace', exemplified by its quiet streets, open air market and waterfront Chinese temple.</p>
<p>Sri Aman has always seen a good number of tourists come its way, thanks to the nearby attraction, Batang Ai National Park. It's also located on the Batang Lupar River, which is the only river in the world where a tidal bore, or fast rising water, occurs every single day.
